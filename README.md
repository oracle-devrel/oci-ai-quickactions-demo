# OCI Data science AI Quick actions - Demo.

`AI Quick Actions` are a suite of actions that together can be used to deploy, evaluate and fine tune foundation models in OCI Data Science. AI Quick Actions target a user who wants to quickly leverage the capabilities of AI. They aim to expand the reach of foundation models to a broader set of users by providing a streamlined, code-free and efficient environment for working with foundation models. AI Quick Actions can be accessed from the Data Science Notebook. [Read more](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/ai-quick-actions.htm)
